## Work Attribution

Which team members were involved in leveling up the project for each of the different aspects?  Put names that did more earlier.  If there is disagreement between team members, look at the commit history (`git log` or `git blame` on specific lines), and if there still is a disagreement, put all names involved and also enter "DISAGREEMENT".  Please send me an email detailing these disagreements.

You must fill in the member that was responsible for that module as declared in your "Group Responsibility Specification".
Remember that three modules were the responsibility of a *single* team member, and the responsibility for the last was shared.
